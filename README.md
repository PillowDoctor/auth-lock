# auth-lock
experiment to make an authentication module

**End Goal:**  
Construct a server that stores and checks `Serial Number`  

once the `Serial Number` is checked and passed by the server, hard weld the sofware to the machine through means of `Indetification` (MAC, IMEI?).  This will result this copy of the software not running on anyother machines

This serial number will then be invalidated for second use.

Doing so will hope to increase the difficulties to pirate my software, so that average people without knowlege in computer science can't do so easily.
